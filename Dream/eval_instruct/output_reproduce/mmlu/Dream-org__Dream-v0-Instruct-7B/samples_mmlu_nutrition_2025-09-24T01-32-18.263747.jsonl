Diets containing sufficient other nutrients to promote growth can increase the requirement of vitamin D so that it becomes limiting.\nAnswer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "arg_1": "D"}}, "resps": [[["-4.858056426048279", "0.0"]], [["-5.258617877960205", "0.0"]], [["-0.18387238308787346", "0.0"]], [["-2.1460172533988953", "0.0"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-4.858056426048279", "0.0"], ["-5.258617877960205", "0.0"], ["-0.18387238308787346", "0.0"], ["-2.1460172533988953", "0.0"]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["acc"], "doc_hash": "e843968325ada399135fb0973ae32fb3d17fd41db32b747d141861d2caeef93b", "prompt_hash": "dcaa21a92fcad872e2594acf4b9f45e08704c74ab6b56247b084efe62f72dc75", "target_hash": "d4735e3a265e16eee03f59718b9b5d03019c07d8b6c51f90da3a666eec13ab35", "acc": 1.0}
